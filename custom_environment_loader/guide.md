Notes:

For our custom environment, we will also have a custom py file for launching isaacsim with our environment

Environments are found in `/home/m2m/Downloads/InteriorAgent`
We have over 20 environments downloaded to use!

Check `/home/m2m/Documents/` for some `.usd` files

Python run files are found here, but must be placed in `/home/m2m/isaac-go2-ros2`

**TODO:**

RuntimeError: Simulation context is not initialized! \
We need to run initialization functions in our custom launch script. However, any launches done thru python, will only run a RL sim in the old house environment
